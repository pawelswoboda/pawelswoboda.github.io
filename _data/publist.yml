- title: "Lifted Disjoint Paths with Application in Multiple Object Tracking"
  image: MOT_illustration.png
  description: "We present an extension to the disjoint paths problem in which additional lifted edges are introduced to provide path connectivity priors. We call the resulting optimization problem the lifted disjoint paths problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard by reduction from integer multicommodity flow and 3-SAT. To enable practical global optimization, we propose several classes of linear inequalities that produce a high-quality LP-relaxation. Additionally, we propose efficient cutting plane algorithms for separating the proposed linear inequalities. The lifted disjoint path problem is a natural model for multiple object tracking and allows an elegant mathematical formulation for long range temporal interactions. Lifted edges help to prevent id switches and to re-identify persons. Our lifted disjoint paths tracker achieves nearly optimal assignments with respect to input detections. As a consequence, it leads on all three main benchmarks of the MOT challenge, improving significantly over state-of-the-art."

- title: "A Primal-Dual Solver for Large-Scale Tracking-by-Assignment"
  image: cell_tracking.png
  description: "We propose a fast approximate solver for the combinatorial problem known as tracking-byassignment, which we apply to cell tracking. The latter plays a key role in discovery in many life sciences, especially in cell and developmental biology. So far, in the most general setting this problem was addressed by off-theshelf solvers like Gurobi, whose run time and memory requirements rapidly grow with the size of the input. In contrast, for our method this growth is nearly linear. Our contribution consists of a new (1) decomposable compact representation of the problem;(2) dual block-coordinate ascent method for optimizing the decompositionbased dual; and (3) primal heuristics that reconstructs a feasible integer solution based on the dual information. Compared to solving the problem with Gurobi, we observe an up to 60 times speed-up, while reducing the memory footprint significantly. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on real-world tracking problems."

- title: "Bottleneck potentials in Markov Random Fields"
  image: min_max_eq.gif
  description: "We consider general discrete Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with additional bottleneck potentials which penalize the maximum (instead of the sum) over local potential value taken by the MRF-assignment. Bottleneck potentials or analogous constructions have been considered in (i) combinatorial optimization (e.g. bottleneck shortest path problem, the minimum bottleneck spanning tree problem, bottleneck function minimization in greedoids), (ii) inverse problems with infinity-norm regularization and (iii) valued constraint satisfaction on the (min,max)-pre-semirings. Bottleneck potentials for general discrete MRFs are a natural generalization of the above direction of modeling work to Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) inference in MRFs. To this end we propose MRFs whose objective consists of two parts: terms that factorize according to (i) (min,+), i.e. potentials as in plain MRFs, and (ii) (min,max), i.e. bottleneck potentials. To solve the ensuing inference problem, we propose high-quality relaxations and efficient algorithms for solving them. We empirically show efficacy of our approach on large scale seismic horizon tracking problems."

- title: "Higher-order Projected Power Iterations for Scalable Multi-Matching"
  image: bernard2018hippi.png
  description: "The matching of multiple objects (e.g. shapes or images) is a fundamental problem in vision and graphics. In order to robustly handle ambiguities, noise and repetitive patterns in challenging real-world settings, it is essential to take geometric consistency between points into account. Computationally, the multi-matching problem is difficult. It can be phrased as simultaneously solving multiple (NP-hard) quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) that are coupled via cycle-consistency constraints. The main limitations of existing multi-matching methods are that they either ignore geometric consistency and thus have limited robustness, or they are restricted to small-scale problems due to their (relatively) high computational cost. We address these shortcomings by introducing a Higher-order Projected Power Iteration method, which is (i) efficient and scales to tens of thousands of points, (ii) straightforward to implement, (iii) able to incorporate geometric consistency, (iv) guarantees cycle-consistent multi-matchings, and (iv) comes with theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimentally we show that our approach is superior to existing methods."

- title: "Combinatorial persistency criteria for multicut and max-cut"
  image: triangle-criterion.png
  description: "In combinatorial optimization, partial variable assignments are called persistent if they agree with some optimal solution. We propose persistency criteria for the multicut and max-cut problem as well as fast combinatorial routines to verify them. The criteria that we derive are based on mappings that improve feasible multicuts, respectively cuts. Our elementary criteria can be checked enumeratively. The
more advanced ones rely on fast algorithms for upper and lower bounds for the respective cut problems and max-flow techniques for auxiliary min-cut problems. Our methods can be used as a preprocessing technique for reducing problem sizes or for computing partial optimality guarantees for solutions output by heuristic solvers. We show the efficacy of our methods on instances of both problems from computer vision, biomedical image analysis and statistical physics."

Our formulation allows for partial pairwise matchings, guarantees cycle consistency, and our objective incorporates both linear and quadratic costs. Moreover, we also present an extension to higher-order costs. In order to solve the convex relaxation we employ a message passing algorithm that optimizes the dual problem. We experimentally compare our algorithm on established benchmark problems from computer vision, as well as on large problems from biological image analysis, the size of which exceed previously investigated multi-graph matching instances."
