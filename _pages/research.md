# Research

Our goal is to develop efficient and scalable optimization algorithms for a wide range of discrete optimization problems in computer vision and image analysis.
To do so, we investigate general theoretic algorithmic techniques, implement them in reusable libraries and test them on specific discrete optimization problems from computer vision and beyond.
