title: 'Efficient Message Passing for 0â€“1 ILPs with Binary Decision Diagrams'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/lange2020efficient'
excerpt: 'Is combining the efficieny of dedicated solvers for narrow classes of combinatorial problems together with the generality of general purpose ILP solvers like Gurobi or CPLEX possible (at least for structured prediction)? In this work we present a generally applicable solver that scales to very large problem sizes, has built-in parallelism and delivers high quality solutions and lower bounds for a variety of structured prediction problems. To this end we use binary decision diagrams to represent small subparts of the full problem. These are glued together and updates via message passing.'
