title: 'Lifted Disjoint Paths with Application in Multiple Object Tracking'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/hornakova2020lifted
excerpt: 'We present the lifted disjoint paths problem, a natural and elegant abstraction for the multiple object tracking problem. Our new formulation takes into account the constraint structure of the disjoint paths problem and augemnts it with long-range interactions by means of lifted edges. We present a globally optimal solver and set a new state of the art for MOT15/16/17.'
