title: 'Making Higher Order MOT Scalable: An Efficient Approximate Solver for Lifted Disjoint Paths'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/hornakova2021making
excerpt: 'Can we make solvers for the lifted disjoint paths problem scale to large problems from the MOT20 challenge? Our message passing based tracker scales to long and crowded sequences without sacrificing solution quality compared to slower and optimal solvers. We achieve state of the art performance on MOT15/16/17 and 20.'
