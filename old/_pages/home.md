Welcome to the Combinatorial Computer Vision group page at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/).
Our goal is to develop efficient and scalable algorithms for discrete optimization problems in computer vision and beyond.
